lazy loading

can you please create me an image page in the admin panel. It should show all the images on the database as a grid, be able to delete them from the database and be able to upload new images to the database. Also, I want to be able to add multiple images to each task in src/routes/admin/\_admin/tasks.tsx. I'm not sure if I should use filenames or thumbnails to select the images though... what would you suggest
